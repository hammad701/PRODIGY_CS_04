Simple Keylogger Simulator (Ethical) 🔐

This project is an ethical, user-consent based keystroke logging simulator developed in Python as Task-04 during a Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

The purpose of this tool is to demonstrate how keystrokes can be recorded and saved within an application context, while strictly respecting ethical boundaries and user permissions.

⚠️ Ethical Considerations

This project is NOT a real keylogger.

No system-wide keystroke capturing

No background monitoring

No OS-level hooks

No data theft or surveillance

Explicit user consent is required

The tool logs only what the user types inside the program and is intended solely for educational and security awareness purposes.

🛠️ Features

User-consent based input logging

Logs keystrokes entered within the application

Saves logged input to a local file

Timestamped entries

Simple command-line interface

Safe and ethical implementation

🚀 How to Run
Requirements

Python 3.x

Steps

Clone the repository or download the files

Run the program:

python keystroke_logger.py


Read the ethical notice and provide consent

Start typing input inside the program

Type EXIT to stop logging

📂 Output

All logged keystrokes are stored in:

keystrokes.log


Each entry includes a timestamp for clarity and analysis.

🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand how keystroke logging works

Learn the importance of ethical boundaries in cybersecurity

Demonstrate secure and consent-based logging practices

Build awareness of keylogger risks and defenses
